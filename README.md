## Introduction

This repository holds a SPA made with React and Typescript, to be showcased in my portfolio (and my own personal use).

Time tracking applications can help individuals or teams understand how they are using their time throughout the day, and identify where they are spending too much time or not enough time. By identifying areas of improvement, we can become more productive and accomplish more in less time.

With this single page application you will be able to track your time and improve your productivity by focusing on the tasks with the highest impact.

## Description

You can start a timer and leave it running in the background, then come back and stop it when you've finished your task. You can add the timestamps manually as well. (The timer mechanism does not rely on intervals).

See your work history organized in chronological order, every part of the display is interactive and editable to provide the best user experience.

Group your tasks into projects, so you can be more organized and gain insight analyzing the data in different graphs that summarize all the time you've spent on said projects.
