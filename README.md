# time-tracker

## Description
With this application you will be able to track your time and improve your productivity by focusing on the tasks with the highest impact.

This is a Work In Progress (WIP) to be showcased on my online portfolio.

Check out the live build version at:

https://carlos-quintana.github.io/time-tracker/

Here are some current features that I will be progressively implementing in this project:

- ~To keep track of time even when the application is closed, by logging the time and date of the entries instead of keeping the time in memory.~

- ~Be able to add, delete and edit projects to organize the tasks.~

- To extract useful metrics from the different entries.



## How to use
>*The following text was mostly generated by Create React App*

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
